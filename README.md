Overview
Project EvolveEd is a Business Analysis case study that explores how Artificial Intelligence (AI) and entrepreneurial learning can be integrated into the UK education system to create a curriculum that reflects the needs of the digital economy.
The project analyses the limitations of the current National Curriculum, identifies stakeholder needs, and proposes a conceptual framework for an adaptive, AI-enabled education model that equips learners with 21st-century skills — creativity, critical thinking, digital literacy, and innovation.

Project Objectives
Analyse the current challenges within the UK schooling system and curriculum design.
Identify key stakeholder requirements for a modernised, AI-integrated education framework.
Design conceptual “As-Is” and “To-Be” process models showing the transition toward AI-assisted learning.
Evaluate solution options and recommend a transformation strategy.
Develop a business case demonstrating the value of integrating AI and entrepreneurial education into national policy.

🧩 Business Need
The traditional UK curriculum was built to serve the industrial era, prioritising standardisation and compliance.
In contrast, today’s world demands adaptability, digital fluency, and creative problem-solving.
Employers are facing an expanding skills gap, while students increasingly feel disconnected from real-world learning and opportunities.
Project EvolveEd presents a vision for future-proof education — one that balances academic foundations with AI-enabled personalisation and entrepreneurial empowerment.
